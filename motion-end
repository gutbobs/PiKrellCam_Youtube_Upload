# Script to ssh copy a motion video file from the pi to an archive site.
# If this script is configured to be run as the on_motion_end command, than
# motion videos can be immediately saved to a backup site as long as the
# backup site is online.
#
# This script should be configured in ~/.pikrellcam/pikrellcam.conf and not
#   in the at-command.conf file.  Eg in pikrellcam.conf:
#   on_motion_end $C/motion-end $v $P $G
#
# Argument substitution done by PiKrellCam before running this script:
#   $C - scripts directory so this script is found.
#   $v - the full path name of the motion video just saved.
#	$P - the command FIFO so we can write an inform notice to display on the
#        PiKrellCam web page (not used yet).
#   $G - log file configured in ~/.pikrellcam/pikrellcam.conf.
#

# ====== WARNING ======
# This script will fail on hosts that are not authenticated, so you may need
# to initially do a manual ssh or scp to the host and answer yes when asked if
# you want to continue connecting so the host will be added to the list of
# known hosts.
